The log file is binary and consists of frames.
Each frame has the following format:
<0xCA> <length_byte> <data byte> <data byte> <data...> <checksum byte>

The checksum is a simple uint8_t sum of all data bytes.

Data bytes contain structures from logger_frames.h.
Byte order is little-endian. Structures have reserved
bytes to avoid padding issues.

See web_software/index.html for example parsing code.
