The firmware consists of the main application and a bootloader.
The bootloader can read new application firmware from SD card
and update the device.

How to build the bootloader:
1. cd bootloader
2. make
3. Binaries will appear in the 'build' directory. Use a
   debugger/programmer to flash bootloader.hex to the device

How to build the application:
1. cd obdlogger
2. make
3. Binaries will appear in the 'build' directory.

main-standalone.hex/bin can be simply flashed by using a JTAG/SWD programmer.

main-bootloadable.bin has to be encrypted and signed by the 'sign_firmware'
utility (go to 'firmware_signing' and type make to build it). 
The encrypted and signed .bin file has to be placed on the SD card in OBDLOG
directory. The device must have the bootloader flashed beforehand.
The bootloader will install the application from that file.
